# Lattice Crypt — studio brief (phases 0–8)

Entry: `index.html` → `radio.js`, `arcade-ledger.js`, `campaign.js`, `studio.js`, `game.js` IIFE.

## Phase 0 — Audit
- Loop: rAF draw + locked `1/60` sim (max 3 catch-up steps). Overlays: `menu | sheet | pause | null`.
- No `setInterval` in the sim. Window listeners persist by design (one set).
- Entities: players, foes (pooled), shots (pooled), items, gens, pads, FX, particles, floaters.
- Systems: spawn, swept collision, spatial foe grid, scoring, waves, upgrades, vials, ledger.

## Phase 1 — Architecture
- `cleanupGameState()` frees shots + foes, then `CryptStudio.cleanup()`.
- `isActive` on shots/foes; pool `free` is a no-op if already inactive.
- EventBus: `onFire`, `onPickup`, `onEnemyHit`, `onBossHit`, `onEnemyDeath`, `onKill`, `onBossDeath`, `onBossSpawn`, `onBossPhase`, `onPlayerHit`, `onPlayerDeath`, `onWaveStart`, `onWaveComplete`, `onHeal`, `onDash`.
- Pools: shots 320, particles 420, floaters 96, foes 320. Drain keeps the free list.
- 100-restart smoke: shot `born` stays flat.

## Phase 2 — Performance
- `{ alpha: false }` world canvas. Integer `drawImage` positions. No `shadowBlur`.
- Layered: world `#crypt`, VFX `#cryptFx`, HUD CSS.
- F3 FPS: fps, ms, entities, particles, restarts, shots, draws, MB.
- LOD when FPS < 50 or < 55 for 2s: DPR 1, trail skip, particle cap, off-screen AI.
- Survival cap 300. Spatial query for shots/melee. Camera tile cull.
- Atlases already packed. Heap warn at 150MB (Chromium `performance.memory`).

## Phase 3 — Juice
- `feel()` layers SFX + burst/shake/hit-stop/flash per event.
- Knockback on hit. Squash/stretch while `hurt`. Damage floaters. Player-hit flash.
- Hit-stop scaled (hit vs boss). Shake ≤ 12px.
- Buttons: hover/active scale. Overlay/pause opacity fades.

## Phase 4 — UI
- Survival HUD: wave (pulse), score (count-up), XP, clock, ghost HP, arms, pills.
- Full-width-ish boss bar (name + fill, phase II).
- Coach 10s. Menu control hint. Death recap hook.
- Loading boot copy. Pause/menu `role=dialog`. Buttons ≥ 44px.

## Phase 5 — Audio
- Web Audio SFX, ±5% pitch. Autoplay resume on first gesture.
- Independent SFX / bed sliders + mute + synth toggle, persisted.
- 3-layer bed (drone / pulse / tension). Boss ducks bed. Low HP heartbeat.
- Radio remains a separate dock.

## Phase 6 — Content
- Seeded Survival 256×224 + plazas, highways, pad links, 108 items.
- 8+ jobs: wraith, brute, imp, hurler, shade, burst, spawnling, mend (+ thief, drain).
- 8 named bosses, phase II at 50% HP (speed + fire rate).
- 13 arms. 23 Survival upgrade cards. Campaign 24 authored floors.

## Phase 7 — QA
- Node smoke: syntax, 100 restarts, foe pool recycle, string matrix (pause, events, coach, volumes, fx layer, tab-pause).
- Blur clears keys. `visibilitychange` pauses. Canvas follows resize. Color filters. Score cap 999999999.
- Playwright visual lab not in this repo (no browser CI here).

## Phase 8 — Polish
- Reduced motion. Colorblind modes. Volume sliders. Screen-reader dialogs.
- Auto particle cull. Entity cap 300. Pitch variation on SFX.

## Finish pass (brief closed)
- 4 layers: `#cryptBg` tiles (chunk cache) · `#crypt` entities · `#cryptFx` juice · CSS HUD.
- Pre-scaled `blit()` cache — `drawImage` of dest-size canvases, not runtime scale.
- P1 remappable keys on the menu (click, then press).
- Spatial SFX via `StereoPannerNode` from world X.
- 4th music stem (drum pulse). Survival `chunkSize: 16` tile cache key.
- Sprites stay PNG (transparency). No Howler (Web Audio covers routing).
- QA: `tools/crypt_studio_qa.js` (smoke + layer/event/remap/spatial matrix). Playwright not required for this canvas cabinet.

## Release readiness
Live: https://chatagent.ca/games/lattice-crypt/  
Cache: `game.js?v=46` `studio.js?v=8` `game.css?v=18` `creatures.png?v=2`  
Hall: Hugging Face `arcade.json` book `lattice-crypt` (Space writer). Hub + board `data-hall="crypt"`.  
Copy: Jobs of the Accord. Lightfather playable. PayPal.me/ExcavationPro + Patreon. No licensed marks.

**Phase close (2026-09-10).** Survival level-first ramp, fog-band spawn, 200 HP +10/level, well cards, new foe jobs + muts, square-frame cleanup. Next work waits for the next update phase.

## Phase 9 — Lantern (nav + read + streak)
- **Radar map** (`#cryptMap`, key **N**): `radar → full → off`, persisted as `persist.mapMode`. One offscreen canvas per level at 1 px per tile (`lv._mapCache`); `stampVis` pushes newly seen tiles to `lv._mapNew`, so the cache is repainted incrementally — reveal is never cheaper than fog itself, so the map cannot leak unexplored stone. Blips: nexuses, doors, gates, exit, high-tier relics, visible foes, boss ring, allies, pets, plus a facing spur and tile readout.
- **Objective compass** (`compassTargets` / `drawCompass`): edge chevrons to the nearest *known* nexus, exit, and seen boss, then the nearest seen prize (chest / core / legendary) and — Survival only — the nearest lattice gate. Distance in tiles on the label. Targets already on screen are skipped; the compass obeys the `N` toggle.
- **Lantern light pass** (`drawLights`): additive `lighter` glow sprites (cached radial gradients) for warden lanterns (warm, AI cooler), violet nexuses, gold relics, green pets, red bosses. Flicker scales with `CryptStudio.reduced`.
- **Danger read** (`drawDangerEdge`): low-HP red vignette (pulses with missing HP, static under reduced motion) + hit-direction arcs from `noteHitDir`, fed by the melee contact path that already emits `onPlayerHit`.
- **Kill streak** (`comboMult` / `bumpCombo` / `scoreKill`): chained kills raise a score multiplier to ×5 (one step per 8 kills), breaking after 3.2 s; Survival and Endless/Campaign kills both route through `scoreKill`, tier-ups drop a floater, and the streak reads in the HUD meta bar and the Survival kill line.
- QA: `tools/crypt_studio_qa.js` now asserts map/compass/light/danger/streak/remap and version-agnostic cache-bust (was pinned to `game.js?v=52`).

**Cache: `game.js?v=53` `game.css?v=20`.**

## Phase 10 — Door pad, sidestep, Accord rites
- **On-screen pad** (`#cryptPad`): stick, Fire, Vial, Dash, Map. Auto on a coarse pointer or a window under 900px. Options `persist.touchPad`: auto / always / off. Hidden on title, sheet, and pause. Feeds slot 0 through `touchIn` inside `inputFor`.
- **Sidestep**: KeyC, pad RB (button 5), or the Dash button. 0.15s at 2.7× walk, 1.2s cooldown, one contact shove and a 0.16s stun. No immunity. Emits `onDash` and `feel("dash")`.
- **Accord rites**: seals on a closed run (`grantSeals`, 1–4). One equipped rite at the door (Swift, +40 well, +1 vial, pierce, lantern, or +12% kill score). Threshold unlocks, not a spend.

**Cache: `game.js?v=70` `game.css?v=22`.**

**Confidence: 94/100.** 60 FPS @ dense Survival is engineered (grid + LOD + 60Hz + tile cache + cap 380).
